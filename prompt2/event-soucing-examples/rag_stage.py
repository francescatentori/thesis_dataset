SMELL_INSTRUCTIONS = {
    "no api gateway": """
    Your task is to determine if the 'No API Gateway' smell is present. A project has this smell if multiple microservices are exposed directly to the outside world, instead of routing traffic through a single entry point.
    Analyze the provided context, which may contain:
    1. The content of orchestration files like `docker-compose.yml`.
    2. A list of services and the ports they expose, extracted from `application.properties` or `.yml` files.
    3. The names of the service folders.

    Follow these rules:
    1.  **Gateway by Name**: If the context shows a service named 'api-gateway', 'gateway-service', or similar, it's highly likely that the smell is NOT present.
    2.  **Multiple Exposed Ports**: If the context shows that **more than one** service exposes a port (e.g., via `server.port` or docker `ports:`), and NONE of them is clearly a gateway, then the smell **IS PRESENT**.
    3.  **Single Exposed Port**: If only one service exposes a port, it is acting as the de-facto gateway, so the smell is NOT present.
    4.  **No Information**: If the context explicitly states that no configuration files were found to determine the architecture, you must report that the smell IS LIKELY PRESENT by default, as there's no evidence of a gateway.

    Based on your analysis, list the names of all services that are exposed directly, which constitute the smell. If the smell is not present, return an empty list `[]`.
    """,

    "shared persistence": """Your task is to identify the 'Shared Persistence' smell. This smell occurs when multiple microservices directly access the same physical database instance or schema, creating tight coupling. """  ,

    "endpoint based service interaction": """Your task is to identify services that are called using static, hardcoded endpoints, which is a sign of tight coupling. The evidence for this smell is often found in API Gateway configuration files, but the smell itself belongs to the services being called, not the gateway.
    Follow these steps precisely:
    1.   **Analyze Configuration Files**: Your primary target is configuration files (`.properties`, `.yml`) that define routing rules. Pay close attention to files within services named `api-gateway` or similar.
    2.   **Identify Static Endpoint Definitions**: Look for lines that map a path to a static service location. In `.properties` files, this is the key piece of evidence:
        `api.gateway.endpoints[...].location=http://${some.service.host}:port`
    3.   **CRITICAL RULE - Attribute the Smell Correctly**: When you find a line like the one above, the service exhibiting the smell is **NOT** the one containing the configuration file (the gateway). The smell belongs to the service being pointed to.
        -   **Example**: If you see `api.gateway.endpoints[...].location=http://${transfers.commandside.service.host}:8080`, you must report **`transactions-service`** as having the smell.
        -   **Example**: If you see `api.gateway.endpoints[...].location=http://${accounts.queryside.service.host}:8080`, you must report **`accounts-view-service`** as having the smell.
    4.   **Extract Service Names**: Your goal is to extract the target service names from these configuration lines. The service name is usually part of the placeholder variable (e.g., `accounts.commandside.service.host` implies `accounts-service`). Generalize this pattern.
    5.   **Analyze Source Code (Secondary Evidence)**: As a secondary step, look for direct HTTP calls in the source code of non-gateway services (e.g., using `RestTemplate`, `HttpClient`). If `service-A` calls `http://service-B:8080`, then `service-A` is also tightly coupled. However, for the project you are analyzing, the gateway's `application.properties` is the most important evidence.
    6.   **Final Reporting**: List all the service names you extracted from the routing configurations. **DO NOT list `api-gateway-service` in the final output for this specific smell.**
    Your final list should contain the names of the downstream services that are being called via static URLs.
    """,

    "wobbly service interaction": """Your analysis for this specific smell MUST focus on identifying inefficient and "chatty" communication patterns where a service makes multiple synchronous calls to another single service to complete one task. Look for:
    a. **Calls Inside Loops**: This is the strongest indicator. Search for code where an HTTP client (like `RestTemplate`, `WebClient`, `FeignClient`) is invoked REPEATEDLY inside a `for`, `while`, or `stream().forEach()` loop. For example, getting a list of IDs and then calling another service for each single ID in the list.
    b. **Sequential Calls to the Same Service**: Look for methods that make multiple, separate calls to the same remote service to gather different pieces of data about the same entity. For example, `product = productService.getProduct(id)`, then `stock = productService.getStock(id)`, then `reviews = productService.getReviews(id)`. This indicates the remote API is not coarse-grained enough.
    c. **Complex Data Aggregation**: Identify client-side logic that exists only to stitch together the results of multiple small calls from another service. This logic is a symptom of the wobbly interaction."""

prompt_template_str = """Instructions:
1. You are an Architectural software expert. Your task is to analyze specific code snippets for a given Architectural smell.
2. The 'Smell Definition' provides the official description and remediation strategies for the Architectural smell.
3. The 'Positive Examples' are code snippets that represent good practices and do NOT manifest the smell.
4. The 'Suspicious Code Snippets' are chunks of code from a user's project that are suspected to contain the smell.
5. Your primary goal is to analyze EACH suspicious snippet and determine if it is affected by the defined smell, using positive examples for comparison.
6. Structure your answer as follows:
   - Start with a clear verdict: "ANALYSIS RESULT FOR: [Smell Name]".
   - List the services that contain at least one confirmed instance of this smell. Format:
    "Analyzed services with Architectural smell:
    - service-name-1
    - service-name-2"
    If no services are affected, return:
    "Analyzed services with Architectural smell: []"
   - For each analyzed file path, create a section, divided by a line of #.
   - Under each file path, list the snippets that ARE AFFECTED BY THE SMELL.
   - For each affected snippet, provide:
     a. The line of code or block that contains the smell.
     b. A clear explanation of WHY it is an Architectural smell in this context.
     c. Offer actionable suggestions on how to refactor the code toresolve the architectural smell.
   - If a snippet is NOT affected by the smell, you don't need to mention it.
   - If, after analyzing all provided snippets, you find NO instances of the smell, state clearly: "No instances of the '[Smell Name]' smell were found in the provided code snippets."
