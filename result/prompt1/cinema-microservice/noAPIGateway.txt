ANALYSIS RESULT FOR: no api gateway

Analyzed services with Architectural smell: - api-gateway

/cinema-microservice/api-gateway/src/server/server.js
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware')
const spdy = require('spdy')

const start = (container) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const {port, ssl} = container.resolve('serverSettings')
    const routes = container.resolve('routes')

    if (!routes) {
      reject(new Error('The server must be started with routes discovered'))
    }
    if (!port) {
      reject(new Error('The server must be started with an available port'))
    }

    const app = express()

    for (let id of Reflect.ownKeys(routes)) {
      const {route, target} = routes[id]
      app.use(route, proxy({
        target,
        changeOrigin: true,
        logLevel: 'debug'
      }))
    }

    if (process.env.NODE === 'test') {
      const server = app.listen(port, () => resolve(server))
    } else {
      const server = spdy.createServer(ssl, app)
        .listen(port, () => resolve(server))
    }
  })
}

module.exports = Object.assign({}, {start})
```
Explanation: This code snippet shows the API gateway implementation using `http-proxy-middleware`. This suggests that the application is using a centralized API gateway, which is the opposite of the "no API gateway" smell.  The gateway is responsible for routing requests to different backend services based on the requested route. This approach can introduce a single point of failure and performance bottleneck if not scaled properly. It also contradicts the principle of decentralized microservices architecture where services should communicate directly.
