```
Explanation:
The API Gateway is exhibiting the wobbly service interaction smell because its integration tests directly call different URLs and ports, suggesting that it's aware of the internal deployment details of other services.  A robust API gateway should abstract away these details, routing requests based on consistent paths and not relying on specific IP addresses and ports.  This tight coupling makes the system brittle and difficult to change, as any alteration in a downstream service's deployment could break the API gateway's integration tests and potentially its functionality.  This violates the principle of loose coupling and makes the system less maintainable.  A better approach would be to configure the API gateway to route requests based on service names or other abstract identifiers, and then use service discovery or a similar mechanism to resolve the actual endpoint at runtime.  This would decouple the services and make the system more resilient to change.

```javascript
it('can send a notification through api-gateway', function (done) {
    this.timeout(3000)
    const url = 'https://192.168.99.101:8080'
    const api = supertest(url)
    console.log(`Calling the server ${url}`)
    const payload = {
      city: 'Morelia',
      userType: 'loyal',
      totalAmount: 71,
      cinema: {
        name: 'Plaza Morelia',
        room: '1',
        seats: '53, 54'
      },
      movie: {
        title: 'Assasins Creed',
        format: 'IMAX',
        schedule: new Date()
      },
      orderId: '1aa90cx',
      description: 'some description',
      user: {
        name: 'Cristian Ramirez',
        email: 'cristiano.rosetti@gmail.com'
      }
    }
    api.post('/notification/sendEmail')
      .send({payload})
      .expect(200, done)
  })
})
```
Explanation:
Similar to the previous example, this snippet shows the API gateway directly calling a specific URL and port for the notification service. This hardcoded dependency creates a wobbly interaction, as changes in the notification service's deployment (e.g., port change) would require modifying the API gateway's tests and configuration.  This tight coupling is a clear indicator of the wobbly service interaction smell.

```javascript
const testPayment = {
      userName: 'Cristian Ramirez',
      currency: 'mxn',
      number: '4242424242424242',
      cvc: '123',
      exp_month: '12',
      exp_year: '2017',
      amount: 71,
      description: `
        Tickect(s) for movie "Assasins Creed",
        with seat(s) 47, 48
        at time 8 / feb / 17`
    }
    api.post('/payment/makePurchase')
      .send({paymentOrder: testPayment})
      .expect(200, done)
  })
```
Explanation:
This snippet demonstrates the same issue as the others. The API gateway is directly interacting with the payment service using a hardcoded URL, exhibiting the wobbly service interaction smell.  The lack of abstraction makes the system fragile and tightly coupled.
