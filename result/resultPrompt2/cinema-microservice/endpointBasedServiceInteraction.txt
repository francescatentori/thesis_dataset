ANALYSIS RESULT FOR: endpoint based service interaction

Analyzed services with Architectural smell:
- movies-service
- cinema-catalog-service
- booking-service

Snippet from file: /cinema-microservice/api-gateway/integration-test/index.js
```javascript
const url = 'https://192.168.99.100:8080'
    const api = supertest(url)

    api.get('/movies/premieres')

```
Explanation: The `api-gateway` uses a hardcoded IP address and port to communicate with the `movies-service`. This creates tight coupling and makes the system less flexible.

Refactoring Suggestions: Replace the hardcoded URL with a logical service name (e.g., `movies-service`) and use a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Docker DNS, Kubernetes service names, or a dedicated service rsegistry like Consul or Eureka) to resolve the actual endpoint at runtime.  The `api-gateway` should use a load-balanced client like `RestTemplate` (with Ribbon) or an equivalent.

```javascript
const url = 'https://192.168.99.101:8080'
    const api = supertest(url)

    api.get('/cinemas/588ababf2d029a6d15d0b5bf/1')

```
Explanation: Similar to the previous example, the `api-gateway` uses a hardcoded IP address and port to interact with the `cinema-catalog-service`.

Refactoring Suggestions:  Use a logical service name (e.g., `cinema-catalog-service`) instead of the hardcoded URL and rely on service discovery. Implement a load-balanced client within the `api-gateway`.

```javascript
const url = 'https://192.168.99.102:8080'
    const api = supertest(url)

    api.post('/booking')

```
Explanation: The `api-gateway` is directly addressing the `booking-service` using a hardcoded IP and port.

Refactoring Suggestions:  Refactor to use the service name (`booking-service`) and leverage service discovery.  The client in the `api-gateway` should be configured for load balancing.

Snippet from file: /cinema-microservice/api-gateway/src/docker/docker.js
```javascript
const getUpstreamUrl = (serviceDetails) => {
      const {PublishedPort} = serviceDetails.Endpoint.Spec.Ports[0]
      return `http://${dockerSettings.host}:${PublishedPort}`
    }

```
Explanation: This function constructs URLs using a fixed `dockerSettings.host` and the dynamically obtained `PublishedPort`. While the port is dynamic, the host remains static, leading to the endpoint-based service interaction smell.

Refactoring Suggestions: Instead of relying on `dockerSettings.host`, use the service name as the hostname in the URL.  This allows Docker's internal DNS or Kubernetes service discovery to resolve the correct container IP at runtime.  For example, if the service name is `movies-service`, the URL should be constructed as `http://movies-service:${PublishedPort}`.

Snippet from file: /cinema-microservice/api-gateway/src/server/server.js
```javascript

    for (let id of Reflect.ownKeys(routes)) {
      const {route, target} = routes[id]
      app.use(route, proxy({
        target,
        changeOrigin: true,
        logLevel: 'debug'
      }))
    }
```
Explanation: This code snippet uses the `target` URL obtained from the `routes` object.  If these `target` URLs are static (as seen in the `docker.js` file), this perpetuates the endpoint-based interaction smell.

Refactoring Suggestions: Ensure that the `routes` object is populated with dynamic URLs based on service names, not hardcoded IPs and ports. This relies on the refactoring suggested for the `docker.js` file.  The `proxy` configuration should then work correctly with the resolved service names.
