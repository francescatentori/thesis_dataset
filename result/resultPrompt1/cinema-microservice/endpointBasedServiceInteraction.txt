```
Explanation:
The API Gateway is exhibiting the endpoint-based service interaction smell.  Instead of abstracting the underlying services, the gateway is directly exposing endpoints of those services.  This is evident in the different URLs used for different operations:
- `192.168.99.100:8080` for movie information.
- `192.168.99.101:8080` for cinema schedules.
- `192.168.99.102:8080` for bookings.

This tight coupling between the gateway and the services' endpoints makes the system less flexible and harder to maintain.  If a service's endpoint changes, the gateway needs to be updated as well.  A better approach would be for the gateway to offer a unified interface, hiding the underlying service endpoints and their implementation details.  This would allow services to evolve independently without affecting the gateway's consumers.
