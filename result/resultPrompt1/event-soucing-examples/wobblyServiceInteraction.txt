ANALYSIS RESULT FOR: wobbly service interaction

Analyzed services with Architectural smell: 
- ApiGateway

Path: /event-sourcing-examples/java-spring/api-gateway-service/src/main/java/net/chrisrichardson/eventstore/javaexamples/banking/apigateway/controller/GatewayController.java
```java
  @RequestMapping(value = "/api/**", method = {GET, POST, DELETE})
  @ResponseBody
  public ResponseEntity<String> proxyRequest(HttpServletRequest request) throws NoSuchRequestHandlingMethodException, IOException, URISyntaxException {
    HttpUriRequest proxiedRequest = createHttpUriRequest(request);
    logger.info("request: {}", proxiedRequest);
    HttpResponse proxiedResponse = httpClient.execute(proxiedRequest);
    logger.info("Response {}", proxiedResponse.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
    return new ResponseEntity<>(read(proxiedResponse.getEntity().getContent()), makeResponseHeaders(proxiedResponse), HttpStatus.valueOf(proxiedResponse.getStatusLine().getStatusCode()));
  }
```
Explanation: The API Gateway acts as a central point for all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate backend services. This introduces a tight coupling between the gateway and the backend services, making it difficult to change or evolve the services independently. Any changes to the backend services' APIs require corresponding changes in the gateway's routing logic. This centralized approach can also create a single point of failure and performance bottleneck.  This is a characteristic of the Wobbly Service Interaction smell.
