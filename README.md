# Thesis Dataset

This repository contains the dataset and results of the thesis on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applied to open-source software projects.

## Structure of the repository

- **prompt 1/**: It contains the first prompt used to query the model and, for each project, the RAG system codes and knowledge base.

- **prompt 2/**: It contains the second prompt used to query the model and, for each project, the RAG system codes and knowledge base.

- **result/**: It contains the results obtained from the interaction between the LLM model and each project. Inside:

  - **prompt 1/**: For each project, there are the results generated with prompt 1.
  - **prompt 2/**: For each project, there are the results generated with prompt 2.

## Analysed projects
